# calculator
In this project, I will be creating an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This will demonstrate my understanding so far of the fundamentals of JavaScript as this is the last project of the foundations couse from The Odin Project.

I am looking forward to completing this project and solving the problems I face during the process.

After completing this project, some thoughts that I have are that this was a good challenge for me. Although the idea of making a calculator is simple, understanding the logic behind its functions took some time. I learned to research what I need to understand in order to make the calulator function how I want.

After each update to the calculator, I tested for different edge cases that the user could possibly make. I enjoyed updating the calulator to work and handle these edge cases. This process of testing for things that would break the calculator and then handing those cases was enjoyable.

Some final notes on this project:
    1. I could have spent more time understanding what and how the calculator should work   before beginning coding.
    2. Making sure the display doesn't overflow by rounding could be done better.
