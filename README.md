# calculator
In this project, I will be creating an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

This will demonstrate my understanding so far of the fundamentals of JavaSCript as this is the last project of the foundations couse from The Odin Project.

I am looking forward to completing this project and solving the problems I face during the process.
